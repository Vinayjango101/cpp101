/*
 * Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout used in Line 5, Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
 * Line 2: using namespace std means we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
 * Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space, But we use it to make code more readable.
 * Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
 * Line 5: cout (pronounced as "c-out") is abject used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. in our example it will be "Hello World".
 * Note : C++ is case-sensitive : cout and Cout has different meaning.
 * Note : Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ; .
 * Note : The body of int main() could also be written as: int main() { cout << "Hello World"; return 0; }
 * Line 6 : return 0; ends the main function.
 * Line 7 : Do not forget to add the closing curl bracket } to actually end the main function.
